  <h1><strong>Re: Eileen Dover university application</strong></h1>

<p>Dear, Eileen</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science facility to study as part </p>
<p>of you PhD next year. I will awnser your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<h2>Starting dates</h2>
<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you</p>
<p>could start at the beggining of the semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <Li>First semester: 9 September 2016</Li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>

    <p>Please let us know which start date you would prefer.</p>    
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="https://durhamcollege.ca/mydc/">important university dates</a>   on our website</p>
    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall</p>
    <p>somewhere in the realm of technology. you seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</p>
    <p>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, the ideas you sumbmitted we were most intrigued</p>
    <p>by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
     
      <p>1. Turning h<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benifits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H <sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</p>
      <p>2. Measuring the effect on preformance of funk bassplayers exceeding 30<sup>&#8728;</sup>C (86<sup>&#8728;</sup> F), when the</p>
      <p>audience size increases expotentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3 x 10<sub>4</sub>.)</p>
      <p>3. HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>
     
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the</p>
    <p>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
    <p>Yes you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To awnser you question,</p>
    <p>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions</p>

    <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
      <p>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far back as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</p>
      <p>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
      <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</p>
      <p>involed huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</p>
      <p>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</p>
      <p>modern styles such as twerking</p>
    <p>Artic robot dance</p>  
    <p>An interesting example of historic information,English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</p>
    <p>discovered a new dance style charaecterised by "robotic",stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</p>
    <p>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</p>
    <p>because they were really cold</p>
